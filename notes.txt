Linear Resonant Actuator Specs
Range: 50-250Hz
Best Amplitude: 2-3V

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in RPi.GPIO
https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/PWM/
Use pin number, not GPIO number. For example, pin 18 instead of GPIO 24.

Raspberry Pi
Rohan's (Receiver)
Chelsea's (Sender)

Raspberry Pi Wifi
Need to get receiver's IP to update in sender and receiver's python files for socket everytime we connect.

Procedures for getting RPi's IP address:
1) connect ethernet cable to receiver pi WITHOUT THE WIFI DONGLE
2) command line: ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
3) plug in wifi dongle, wait a bit, command line: ifconfig
4) IP address would be the inet addrress under wlan0 
Repeat the same for sender pi (ssh pi@chelsea.local)
** need to update the ip address in sender.py and receiver.py file to be the receiver pi's ip address for them to talk to each other over wifi

Reading Resistance with Raspberry Pi
Diagram: http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/08/reading-analogue-sensors-with-one-gpio-pin/
RPi does not have any analog inputs, and GPIO pins can only read HIGH and LOW levels. We instead use a basic RC charging circuit. Measure resistance by counting how long it takes for a capacitor to charge and register "HIGH" on a GPIO pin.
